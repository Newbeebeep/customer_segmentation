# 🛒 Customer Segmentation & Purchase Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior using a real-world insurance dataset. By leveraging Python for data preprocessing and Tableau for visualization, it aims to uncover customer insights and trends across geography, policy types, gender, and language preferences.

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib): for data cleaning, feature engineering, and RFM segmentation  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for writing and executing Python code  
- **Tableau**: for creating interactive dashboards to visualize trends and patterns  
- **Git & GitHub**: for version control and portfolio presentation  

## 📁 Project Structure

- `cleaned_customer_data.csv`: Preprocessed data file for Tableau  
- `Customer_RFM_Segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data cleaning and segmentation  
- `Tableau Dashboard`: Interactive report published on Tableau Public  
- `README.md`: Project overview  

## 📌 Key Features

- **RFM Segmentation**: Classify customers by Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics  
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard** including:
  - Geographic heatmap of premium amounts  
  - Policy type trends by year  
  - Gender distribution over time  
  - Language preference trends
